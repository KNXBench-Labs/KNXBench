## 15. Unparsable values survive only on `Override` fields

**Limitation.** A present attribute whose value cannot be parsed keeps its
raw text — and is written back verbatim on export — only where the field
is modelled as `Override<T>` (`Override::Malformed`, ADR-0010's
amendment). On a field modelled as a bare value or an `Option<T>`, an
unparsable value falls back to the type's default and only the report
records what the source actually said.

**Cause.** `Override<T>` exists to carry an attribute's presence state, so
a fourth state costs nothing structurally. A bare `u8` or an
`Option<DateTime<Utc>>` has nowhere to put a string, and widening every
such field would push presence bookkeeping into parts of the model that do
not otherwise need it.

**Impact.** For the affected fields (timestamps, individual addresses,
numeric ids, enums such as `CompletionStatus`) a malformed source value is
reported but not written back: the export is a correct file that differs
from the original in exactly that attribute. No such value occurs in the
reference project — the case is reachable only with hand-broken input.

**Lifted when.** A real project is found that carries unparsable values on
those fields, making the added model surface worth its cost. Until then
the asymmetry is deliberate, documented, and reported at import time.
