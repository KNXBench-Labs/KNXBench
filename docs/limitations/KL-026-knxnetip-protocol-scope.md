This dossier preserves the technical detail and dated history. Earlier
headings, failures and lifting conditions are historical where later
updates supersede them; they are not new work assignments.

## 26. `BusConnection` does not yet support KNX IP Secure

**Limitation.** `crates/knx-net`'s `BusConnection` trait implements
tunnelling and discovery: `discover` multicasts a `SEARCH_REQUEST`
(original form only, not Core v2's `SEARCH_REQUEST_EXTENDED`) and
collects `SEARCH_RESPONSE`s; `connect_tunnel` opens a tunnel to a
gateway by known IP; `subscribe` receives telegrams; `TunnelClient::send`
writes one (`GroupValueWrite` or any other `ApplicationService`, no DPT
interpretation — raw bytes only, same scope cut as the receive side).
`connect_routing` (Cycle 4) sends/receives unconfirmed `ROUTING_INDICATION`
frames over the standard multicast group — no custom multicast address
override, and `ROUTING_BUSY` is decoded and logged but never used to
throttle sends (see the two new limitation entries below). Secure-protocol
paths remain unimplemented. A reader should not assume the trait is
feature-complete because it compiles.

**Cause.** Session 6 Cycle 1 delivered read-only tunnelling as the
foundation for bus monitoring; Cycle 2 added sending; Cycle 3 added
discovery. Cycle 4 added routing. Secure protocols are out of v1 scope, handled by the isolated `knx-secure` crate.

**Impact.** A real KNX installation's gateways can be found on the LAN
without a known IP once `discover()` sends a valid discovery HPAI (a
final-review fix: the discovery socket must stay unconnected to receive
unicast `SEARCH_RESPONSE`s from any gateway, so a naive `local_addr()`
read off it reported the invalid `0.0.0.0:<port>` — see the fix commit
for the resolved-IP/real-port workaround), then handed by control
endpoint to `connect_tunnel` for monitoring/actuation by group address
over a tunnel. Live-hardware verification of the full discover-then-connect
flow was left for the user to run, same as Cycle 2's `send` — this sandbox has no real KNXnet/IP gateway to discover. KNX IP Secure
remains unreachable regardless; routing (unencrypted multicast) is
reachable as of Cycle 4. Discovery inside the `knx-server` Docker container
needs `--network host`: the server and web UI now call `discover`, so §79
applies to the shipped image.

**Lifted when.** Shelved indefinitely as of 2026-09-06 — no fixed
session or cycle owns it. Plain tunnelling/routing covers the common
case; IP Secure only matters for secure-only gateways or installations
with it explicitly enabled. Revisit on demand (a real gateway needing
it), doing the RESEARCH.md §9 spike first, not speculatively. See
[ROADMAP.md, Session 6](../ROADMAP.md).

**Update, 2026-09-11.** Folded into **T19**'s scope (KNX Secure = Data
Secure + IP Secure + keyring). The user's 2026-09-11 ruling on T19 —
deferred, documented as a limitation, not rejected — applies here too; this
2026-09-06 shelving decision and T19's ruling stand together, not as two
separate calls.
